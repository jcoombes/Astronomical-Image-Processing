# Astronomical-Image-Processing

The aim of this project is to use an optical CCD image
of the extragalactic sky to determine the number counts
of galaxies in the local universe.

To find the number of galaxies brighter than a given
magnitude as a function of magnitude, the program reads
the CCD image, detects individual galaxies within the image
and determines their brightness.
